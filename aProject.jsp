        <hr style="color: red;"></center>
        <p>It is Manadatory or Requirement for every university ,organization or
            highschool, Infact every educational institution to maintain the information of each
            indivudual who is undergoing education in that particular educational
            society.Maintaining that large amount of data is overhead to the management and
            requires large effort and time.This is the scenario in wich Student Counselling
            Management System (SCMS) comes in to manage the large amout of data
            efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main objective of SCMS is to manage the details of each indivudual such
            as personal details(family, address, ..), Academic performance, Acheivements,
            Attendance and Remarks. SCMS provides a simple GUI interface wich can be
            understood and maitained by any one.This reduces the effort involved in
            maintaining the student data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scope of SCMS is to record various activities of the user, it simplifies the
            task and reduce paperwork.The SCMS involves in integration of all records of the
            students.

        <h3>Existing System :</h3>
        <p>
            Present system or Existing system of "Counseling Management System" is
            working manually it involves in complete paperwork. In Existing System a record
            has to be maintained for each indivudual to record his activities, maintaining a
            record for each student manually is a difficult task and requires large amounts of
            registers resulting in wastage of paper(space) and man power.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Limitations of the Existing System:</h3>
        <p>
            The maintainance of various records and procedure of reporting are being
            done manually by counselling department.This leads to many drawbacks some
            of wich are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is time consuming process</li>
            <li>Proper arrangements should be made before and and after the examinationwhich
                is both money spending and tie consuming</li>
            <li>As the number of students increases counselling process becomes more and
                more difficult.</li>
            <li>Not globally maintain the information</li>
            <li>Evaluating of counselling records also consumes heavy amount of time</li>
            <li>Difficult to manage all types of information.</li>
            <li>Further more, manual evaluation is more prone to errors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proposed System</h3>
        <h5>Introduction:</h5>
        <p>In proposed system we develop a platform which is accessible to everyone in
            the institution making the information globally available. We try to keep the
            system as simple as possible so that it can be accessced and maintained by any one
            easily. The eavaluation in this system is just a click away ( Provide your
            requirements and click the button and the remaining, SCMS works for you).We
            made the system autonomus works with your commands and the interface we
            made is highly interactive with simple user interface and better UX.
        </p>

        <h3>Features Of The Proposed System:</h3>
        <p>The proposed system is developed with the aim to automate all the activities
            and eliminate all the drawbacks that the existing system of manual operation
            faces. The important features and functionality of proposed system are listed
            below 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><h5>Enhancement:</h5><p>The main objective of Student Counselling Management System is to enhance and upgrade the

            <li><h5>Availability:</h5><p>The transaction reports of the system can be retried as and when required. Thus, there is no
                    delay in the availability of any information, whatever needed, can be captured very quickly and
                    easily.</p></li>
            <li><h5>Maintainance Cost:</h5><p>Reduce the cost of maintenance</p></li>
            <li>The proposed system will save significant amount of time and effort
                invested by the university every year</li>
            <li>The System is fully functional and works on any present day operating
                systems</li>
